Step1:

from the fragment pairs level:

In this folder is all of your merged fragment pairs. (inward, outward, samestrand, trans)

Because each of your cell will generate each type of them. You can just 'cat' each types together to generate only one in, out,same, trans.


./count.sh name genome

Step2:

The folder will generate anchor_loop.$name file and anchor_loop.trans which you would use to do the normalization. 

so the other three you are able to run as previous( input are same)
